			<h1>Fahad's Recipe Website</h1>
			<p>Hi, this is my solution to an assignment by <a href="https://theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>. The Odin Project is a free online resource that helps anyone learn Web Development. It is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>
			<p>This assignment helped me practice html, css and git fundamentals. Thanks for visiting my solution. The recipes you see on this site are generated by ChatGPT. I am not a chef and I take zero accountability if you end up poisoning yourself by following any of the recipes.</p>

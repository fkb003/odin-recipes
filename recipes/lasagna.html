			<li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>

			<li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion is translucent. Drain any excess fat.</li>

			<li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and beaten egg. Mix until well blended.</li>


			<li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>


			<li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese and a third of the Parmesan cheese. Repeat this layering process once more.</li>


			<li>Top the second layer of cheese with three more lasagna noodles and the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle the rest of the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>


			<li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
